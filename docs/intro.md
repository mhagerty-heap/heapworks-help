# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **ServiceDesk in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **adding our tag to your site**.

### What you'll need

- ServiceDesk code snippet
  - Place inside the div of you choosing.

## Start your site

Run the development server to test:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
